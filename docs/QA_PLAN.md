# QA Plan (MVP)

- Map loads and shows 4 seeded detections
- Click point → popup shows counts + wind arrow + verify buttons
- Confirm → point remains, counts update
- Deny → after threshold, point disappears
- Unsure → counts update, point remains
- Rate limit: spam verify quickly → blocked
- Duplicate vote: same device cannot vote twice on same point
